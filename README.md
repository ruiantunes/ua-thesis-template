LaTeX template for theses at University of Aveiro.
Check the guidelines for [master](https://www.ua.pt/en/sga/page/12786) and [PhD](https://www.ua.pt/en/sga/page/4630) theses.


### LaTeX document generation

You can generate the PDF output file with [latexmk](https://ctan.org/pkg/latexmk) using the following command.

```
$ latexmk -lualatex main.tex
```

Alternatively, you can use [TeXstudio](https://www.texstudio.org/), [Texmaker](https://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/), [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with [LaTeX Workshop](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop), or [any other LaTeX IDE](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/339/latex-editors-ides).

Support for both [pdfTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PdfTeX) and [LuaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LuaTeX) engines has been guaranteed in this template, but I encourage you to use the latter.

You can consult further information about this template in the generated PDF.
