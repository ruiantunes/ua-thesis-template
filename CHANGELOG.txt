2024-10-28
==========

- Improving file structure: "toc.tex" is now a separate file containing
  the table of contents. This allows to comment the "first-pages.tex"
  part to reduce compilation time.

- Added a suggestion, in the "main.tex" file, to use the "draft" option
  in the "graphicx" package for a faster compilation.

- Updates according to the UA thesis norms:
  - Now, the first pages are considered to be a one-sided document. That
    is, they do not contain any blank pages (empty pages were removed).
    Only from the table of contents (inclusive) the document is
    considered to be two-sided.

- UA thesis style file (uathesis.sty):
  - The "newLogo" option was removed, but the new logo is still used by
    default.
  - The "oldLogo" option can be used to employ the old logo, and now
    works correctly with the "MAP" option.
  - Now, by default, no horizontal rule is shown in the first pages.

- Added the "ieee.tex" file to easily employ the IEEE BibLaTeX style.

- Other small changes:
  - Right margin changed back to 25mm.
  - Fixed "Underfull \hbox" warnings.

==========

- Added dedication page.

- UA thesis style file (uathesis.sty):

    - Blue and red (accounting).
    - Red, white, and red (economy).
  - The scientific areas "arts+humanities" and "misc" were added.
  - The green color was added for other scientific areas. The RGB values
    of Pantone colors were slightly updated.

    slightly adjusted according to the official values provided by the

2021-08-27
==========

- Solved a bug that was making some headings (table of contents, list
  of figures, list of tables, and bibliography) to be kept uppercase.
  This same bug was also making the appendix heading to have the wrong
  name ("Chapter" instead of "Appendix").

- Changed "fancyhdr" heading (again): chapter is right-aligned at odd
  pages and left-aligned at even pages.

- Make "et al." italic for the Portuguese language.




2021-08-21

  default due to its capabilities with font types (fontspec package).

  USenglish).

- Commands for Latin expressions were added.

- Other small changes.
